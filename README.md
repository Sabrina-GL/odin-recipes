# odin-recipes
This project is a simple Recipes webpage created as part of **The Odin Project**, where I’m applying my foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## Goals and Aspirations
When starting this project, my knowledge of web development was limited to the basics of HTML and CSS—just enough to create a simple page with some basic styling. However, this project marks the beginning of my journey to mastering these technologies.

By the end of the course, I aim to:

* Deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS.
* Build web pages that can turn any of my ideas into reality.
* Create responsive and efficient designs for a seamless user experience.

This project is the first step toward developing the skills I need to craft professional and customer-friendly websites.
